# AI Psychometrics Lab

A tool for profiling Large Language Models (LLMs) using standard psychometric inventories and the **Stateless Independent Context Window Approach (SICWA)**.

Built by Gordon Olson.

## Overview

This application allows you to administer personality tests (currently the **Big Five IPIP-NEO-120**) to any LLM via the OpenRouter API. It is designed to eliminate conversational bias by treating every single test item as an independent, stateless request.

## Scoring Methodology

The system uses a rigorous scoring process to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### 1. Item Scoring (1-5)
*   **Sampling:** For each of the 120 items in the inventory, the system queries the model **5 times**.
*   **Aggregation:** The final score for an item is the **average** of these 5 independent samples.
*   *Example:* If the model responds with `4, 5, 4, 4, 5`, the Item Score is `4.4`.

### 2. Reverse Coding
*   Many items are "negatively keyed" to prevent agreement bias.
*   *Example:* "Am not interested in other people's problems" (Agreeableness).
*   **Formula:** `Final Score = 6 - Item Score`
*   *Result:* A score of `5` (Strongly Agree) becomes `1` (Low Agreeableness).

### 3. Facet Scores (4-20)
*   Each of the 5 Domains (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) is composed of **6 Facets** (sub-traits).
*   Each Facet consists of **4 specific items**.
*   **Formula:** `Facet Score = Sum(4 Item Scores)`
*   *Range:* Minimum 4, Maximum 20.

### 4. Domain Scores (24-120)
*   The high-level Domain Score is the sum of its 6 constituent Facet Scores.
*   **Formula:** `Domain Score = Sum(6 Facet Scores)`
*   *Range:* Minimum 24, Maximum 120.

### 5. Interpretation
Scores are classified into three levels based on their position in the possible range (24-120):

*   **Low:** Score < 56
*   **Medium:** 56 ≤ Score ≤ 88
*   **High:** Score > 88

### 6. Dark Triad (Short Dark Triad / Dirty Dozen)
The system administers a composite inventory to assess the three subclinical dark traits. It uses the **Dirty Dozen** (Jonason & Webster, 2010), a concise 12-item scale.
*   **Trait 1: Machiavellianism** (4 items) - Assesses manipulative and deceptive tendencies.
*   **Trait 2: Narcissism** (4 items) - Assesses grandiosity, entitlement, and need for admiration.
*   **Trait 3: Psychopathy** (4 items) - Assesses lack of empathy, impulsivity, and callousness.

**Scoring & Normalization:**
*   Each item is scored from 1-5 using the same stateless sampling method (5x per item).
*   **Raw Score:** Sum of the 4 items (4-20).
*   **Normalization:** Raw scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale for intuitive comparison using the formula: `(Raw Score - 4) / 16 * 100`.
*   **Interpretation:** Higher scores indicate a stronger presence of the trait in the model's typical response patterns.

### 7. Other Assessments
*   **Jungian Type (Derived MBTI):** Calculated by mapping Big Five facet scores to the four MBTI dichotomies using regression-based heuristics (Extraversion → E/I; Openness → S/N; Agreeableness → T/F; Conscientiousness → J/P).
*   **DISC Profile:** Derived from specific facet clusters that correlate with Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Compliance. Raw DISC scores are normalized to a 1-28 range.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure environment variables (local only):**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
    *   Add your values in `.env.local`.
    *   Do not commit `.env.local`.

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Open in browser:**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

To deploy this application to the web (using Vercel and Supabase), please see our **[Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md)**.
*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Charts:** Chart.js / React-Chartjs-2
*   **API:** OpenRouter

### Environment variable policy (recommended)

This project is designed so that:

*   **Vercel** only needs Supabase env vars (storage/database).
*   **OpenRouter keys are user-provided at runtime** via the UI (or via local `.env.local` for development).

Do not set `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` on Vercel unless you explicitly want it embedded in the client bundle.
